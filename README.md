Password Generator that creates a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) for generating strong, customizable passwords.

The GUI allows users to:
Specify password length.
Choose character types to include (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
Exclude similar characters (like 'l', '1', 'I') and specific characters.
Generate and display the password.
Copy the generated password to the clipboard.
View a basic password strength assessment.
The code utilizes the tkinter library for GUI creation and includes features like:

Clear and organized layout.
Input validation (e.g., minimum password length).
Character set management.
Basic password strength evaluation.
This is a basic example, and it could be further enhanced with features like:

More sophisticated password strength metrics.
Visual password strength indicators (e.g., color-coded bars).
Option to save generated passwords.
Improved user interface (e.g., using a more modern GUI library).
